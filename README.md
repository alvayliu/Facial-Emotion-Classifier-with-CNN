# Facial_Emotion_Classifier
This project was done as a part of the Deep Learning DD2424 course in my Machine Learning degree.  
It features a simple facial emotion classifier with a deep convolutional neural network trained on
the FER-2013 dataset.

To run the code, you'll need to download the FER-2013 dataset and run the script classify.py
In order to find out more about the project and the results, see the pdf-document.
